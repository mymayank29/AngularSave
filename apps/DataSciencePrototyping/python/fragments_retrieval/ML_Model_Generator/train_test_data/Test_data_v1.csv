If controlled storage is unavailable then, a plan for long term storage shall be required and prior to installation an inspection and sparing plan for all metalic and non-metallic components shall be provided by the manufacturer. This is especially critical for humid or environmentally sensitive equipment and components. Procedures should be available for start-up and post start-up operations. Cleaning the reservoir and holding tanks should be performed periodically and inspected for scale, growth, algae and other abnormalities. Have the tanks and reservoirs been cleaned and inspected within the last 6 months? Both the control fluid and glycol supplies should be automated to maintain the correct concentrations during operations. Is the control system equipped with an automatic mixing system? Fluid mixtures and cleanliness is essential to the reliability of the control system and BOPE. Are the proper tools, equipment and procedures are available at the rig site, to inspect the fluids for cleanliness, mixture concentration, Ph and other requirements as recommended by the control system manufacturer?. Hydraulic fluid reservoirs shall be cleaned and flushed of all weld slag, machine cuttings, sand and any other contaminants before fluid is introduced. Cleanout ports/hatches shall be provided for each reservoir to facilitate cleaning. Water-based hydraulic fluids are usually a mixture of potable water and a water-soluble lubricant additive. When ambient temperatures at or below freezing are expected, sufficient volume of ethylene glycol or other additive acceptable to the control system manufacturer shall be mixed with the water-based hydraulic fluid to prevent freezing. Define Define Is a chart or table providing the glycol concentration should be posted at the reservoir tank? Reservoirs and Reservoir Sizing General Because the term ""stored hydraulic fluid"" is referenced many times within this document, the API definition is provided: ""stored hydraulic fluid volume: The fluid volume recoverable from the accumulator system between the system rated working pressure and the precharge pressure"" . A suitable control fluid shall be selected in accordance with 9.5. As stated in 4.2.3.1 above, temperature affects the conditions for precharging the accumulators. Additionally, in many cases the BOP equipment and control systems never get integrated until at the rig site. For engineering to properly design the system, size and quantity of the accumulator bottles, pump sizes, reservoir capacities, etc. they utilize more conservative design criteria to ensure excess volume and pressures are available at the rig site. It is not intended for the BOPE & control systems on the rig to meet these final design requirements. RP-53 addresses the minimum field values for the required pressure and volumes of the integrated systems. Stored Hydraulic Fluid Volume The stored hydraulic fluid volume shall be used in determining the pump system sizing and reservoir capacity required. The stored hydraulic fluid volume is the hydraulic fluid stored in the accumulator from precharge condition to pump stop pressure. Explain: Note that for a given accumulator volume, precharge conditions, and full-charge conditions, Methods B and C have the same stored hydraulic fluid. The difference between the method B and C is due to the difference between an adiabatic discharge which will cool the gas significantly for high-pressure ratios, and an isothermal discharge. Optimal accumulator sizing differences will occur because optimal precharge for an accumulator will be different when temperature effects are considered. Basically, the precharge pressure after adiabatic discharge, with the lower temperature and pressure that occurs with this discharge, will be slightly above the minimum required operating pressure. For Method C, adiabatic expansion shall be used for discharge pressure temperature relationship. This will be conservative with regard to available pressure, as accumulators will have heat transfer from the environment, but it will occur over a period of time that cannot be accurately assessed. Design charging pressure shall be the “pump start pressure” for accumulators subject to main hydraulic supply pressure fluctuations. Design charging pressure shall be the “pump shut-off pressure” for accumulators that are isolated by check valve(s) from the main hydraulic supply pressure fluctuations. 8 Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron Chevron YES or NO YES or NO YES or NO Chevron YES or NO YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO ",5125,False

Are plans in place to ensure that the umbilical reels are inspected daily and deficiencies repaired immediately upon locating the deficiency? YES NO Chevron Chevron Hose reels are used to store, run, and retrieve the umbilical hose bundles that communicate the main hydraulic power fluid supply and command pilot signals to the subsea mounted BOP control pods. The hose reels are equipped with hose reel manifolds having valves, regulators, and gauges for maintaining control through the subsea umbilical of selected functions during running and retrieving of the pod or lower marine riser package and/or the BOP stack. Additional hose handling equipment includes hose sheaves used to support and change direction of the subsea umbilical while maintaining the specified minimum bend radius recommended by the umbilical manufacturer. Umbilical control hose bundles provide the main supply of power fluid and pilot signals from the surface hydraulic control manifold to the subsea control pods mounted on the BOP stack. The subsea umbilical is run, retrieved, and stored on the hose reel. The pilot signals are routed to the hose reels through the appropriate length of surface umbilical jumper hose bundle from the hydraulic connections located on the control manifold. The main hydraulic power fluid supply is normally carried through a I-inch (2.54-centimeter) nominal size supply hose in the hose bundle to the subsea control pod. An alternative to this system is installation of a rigid pipe (conduit) on the marine riser. Separate accumulators may be provided for the pilot control system that may be supplied by a separate pump or through a check valve from the main accumulator system. The dedicated pump, if used, can be either air powered or electric powered. Air pumps should be capable of charging the accumulators to the system working pressure with 75 psi (0.52 MPa) minimum air pressure supply. Provision, should be made to supply hydraulic fluid to the pilot accumulators from the main accumulator system if the pilot pump becomes inoperative.

This safety factor shall be added to the 100% value of the design calculations for the system design to ensure that sufficient volume and pressure are available for completing the rapid discharge sequence. Unlike function testing, the rapid discharge system does not require it to be performed unless specifically addressed in the contracting requirements. a. Stored Hydraulic Fluid. The fluid volume recoverable from the accumulator system between the maximum designed accumulator operating pressure and the precharge pressure. In deep water operations, hydraulic signal transmission time is lengthened by physical expansion of the fluid conductor hose as the internal pressure surges. Electro-hydraulic and multiplex control systems can be used in deep water where response times of hydraulic signals are too lengthy. Electrical command signals transmitted over lengthy subsea cables have shorter response times than hydraulic pilot signals transmitted over hose bundles of equal length. Electrical command signals operate subsea solenoid valves which, in turn, provide hydraulic pilot signals directly to operate the pod valves that direct power fluid to the subsea functions. Electro-hydraulic control systems have parallel capability to execute and receive commands, whereas multiplex control systems process multiple signals on each conductor set. Electro- hydraulic systems have conductor wires in the subsea umbilical cable dedicated to each function. Multiplex (MUX) systems serialize and code the command signals that are then sent subsea via shared conductors in the umbilical cable. Multiplex control system logic may incorporate additional security by requiring verification before execution of the function. Subsea data are electrically transmitted to the surface. Section 14 is redundant to Section 13. Only those items that differ from Direct Hydraulic Control Systems will require confirmation or clarification. Each closing unit should have a fluid reservoir with a capacity equal to at least twice the usable fluid capacity of the accumulator system. A suitable hydraulic fluid should be used as the closing unit control operating fluid. Sufficient volume of glycol must be added to any closing unit fluid containing water if ambient temperatures below 32 0 F (0 0 C) are anticipated. 16 14.2.2 14.2.3 14.2.4 14.2.5 ",2611,False

Pacific Sharav Contract 2012 06 15 Executed - EMail.pdf.txt,NOTHING,"4.2.3.1 above, temperature affects the conditions for precharging the accumulators. Additionally, in many cases the BOP equipment and control systems never get integrated until at the rig site. For engineering to properly design the system, size and quantity of the accumulator bottles, pump sizes, reservoir capacities, etc. they utilize more conservative design criteria to ensure excess volume and pressures are available at the rig site. It is not intended for the BOPE & control systems on the rig to meet these final design requirements. RP-53 addresses the minimum field values for the required pressure and volumes of the integrated systems. Stored Hydraulic Fluid Volume The stored hydraulic fluid volume shall be used in determining the pump system sizing and reservoir capacity required. The stored hydraulic fluid volume is the hydraulic fluid stored in the accumulator from precharge condition to pump stop pressure. Explain: Note that for a given accumulator volume, precharge conditions, and full-charge conditions, Methods B and C have the same stored hydraulic fluid. The difference between the method B and C is due to the difference between an adiabatic discharge which will cool the gas significantly for high-pressure ratios, and an isothermal discharge. Optimal accumulator sizing differences will occur because optimal precharge for an accumulator will be different when temperature effects are considered. Basically, the precharge pressure after adiabatic discharge, with the lower temperature and pressure that occurs with this discharge, will be slightly above the minimum required operating pressure. For Method C, adiabatic expansion shall be used for discharge pressure temperature relationship. This will be conservative with regard to available pressure, as accumulators will have heat transfer from the environment, but it will occur over a period of time that cannot be accurately assessed. Design charging pressure shall be the “pump start pressure” for accumulators subject to main hydraulic supply pressure fluctuations. Design charging pressure shall be the “pump shut-off pressure” for accumulators that are isolated by check valve(s) from the main hydraulic supply pressure fluctuations. 8 Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron Chevron YES or NO YES or NO YES or NO Chevron YES or NO YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO Chevron YES or NO ",2455,False

FIGURE - KEEL BLOCK CONFIGURATION FIGURE - SIMPLE GEOMETRIC SHAPES The ER of the QTC shall be equal to or greater than the dimensions of the part it qualifies, except the size is not required to exceed 5 inches (125 mm) ER. When it is necessary to prepare sub-size specimens, the reduced dimension shall be in the direction parallel to the base of the V-Notch. Impact test specimens shall be removed from a QTC as prescribed in Section 4.7. This QTC shall be used to qualify a heat and the products produced from that heat. ER determination for these parts shall be in accordance with the methods for complex shaped parts. When the QTC is a trepanned outlet or a prolongation removed from a part, the QTC will only qualify parts that are identical in size and shape to the part from which it was removed. When the QTC is a sacrificial part, it qualifies only parts having identical size and shape. A QTC will only qualify material and parts produced from the same heat. Remelt heat may be qualified on a master heat basis. EQUIVALENT ROUND METHODS. Figure 4.7.1.2 and Figure 4.7.1.3 illustrate the basic models for determining the ER of simple solid and hollowed parts and more complicated equipment. The size of a QTC for a part shall be determined using the following Equivalent Round (ER) method: The ER of a part shall be determined using the actual dimensions of the part in the “as heat treated” conditions. SPECIMEN ORIENTATION. The values listed in Table 4.5.6.7 are the minimum acceptable values for forgings and wrought products tested in the transverse direction and for castings and weld qualifications. Forgings and wrought products may be tested in the longitudinal direction instead of the transverse direction and then shall exhibit 20 ft-lbs minimum average impact value. Standard size specimens, 10 x 10 mm in cross section, shall be used except where there is insufficient material. In this case the next smaller standard size specimen obtainable shall be used.

In the event a leak is discovered, it should be repaired immediately. 3. The control panel requires weekly maintenance including such items as checking various fluid levels, cleaning air strainers, cleaning pump strainers, and cleaning filter elements. Tightening of packing and lubrication of power actuating cylinders should be performed on a weekly basis. Re- charge pressure in the accumulator bottles should be checked at this time. 4.

Pacific Sharav Contract 2012 06 15 Executed - EMail.pdf.txt,NOTHING,"5.2.4 and 5.2.5, the CCU shall provide full functional and pressure regulation capability . Upon restoration of power, following an electrical power interruption, the CCU shall boot up all functions in the non-energized position . Command Signals Electrical command signals transmitted over lengthy subsea umbilical cables have shorter response times than hydraulic pilot signals transmitted over hose bundles of equal length. Electrical command signals operate subsea solenoid valves which, in turn, provide hydraulic pilot signals directly to operate the pod valves that direct power fluid to the subsea functions. A MUX control system processes multiple signals on each signal conductor in the umbilical. Multiplex systems serialize and code the command signals which are then sent subsea via shared conductors in the umbilical cable. Multiplex control system logic can incorporate additional security by requiring transmission of a coded message to the subsea pod, return of the message to the surface by the pod electronics package for verification, and re-transmitting the verified command before execution of the function. An electro-hydraulic system has a pair of conductor wires in the subsea umbilical cable dedicated to each function. Explain: Electrical Power Electrical power (excluding the pump systems) shall be supplied from one or more uninterruptable power supplies with backup battery capacities to operate the controls for at least 2 hours . Explain: a. Two (2) complete sets of solenoid valves and pilot-operated control valves with each set mounted in each control pod located on the LMRP. b. Two (2) control cables, each stored on and deployed from an umbilical reel, to connect the two subsea pods to the surface control equipment. c. Two (2) or more means of surface/subsea power fluid supply. (examples: hydraulic conduit[s], hydraulic umbilical hose[s]). At least one of these means shall satisfy the response time requirements specified in this section, and two (or more) supplies shall be selectable from at least two primary control stations. Electro-hydraulic/multiplex (MUX) control systems employ multi-conductor armored subsea umbilical cables deployed from storage reels aboard the vessel. The cables transmit coded commands that activate solenoid operated pilot valves in the subsea pods. Within the pod, each solenoid valve activates a pilot-operated control valve to direct power fluid to a particular function. Explain: Redundancy Because the subsea BOP stack is not easily accessible for maintenance and repair, redundant (backup) system elements shall be deployed. Specifically these include: Accumulators and manifolds for hydraulic control systems for subsea BOP stacks shall meet the requirements of 5.2.

Miscellaneous items such as hose, flexible tubing, electrical cable, pressure gauges, small control line valves, fittings, and electrical components. YES NO Chevron Preventive maintenance of the choke and kill line assemblies should be performed regularly checking, particularly for wear and plugged or damaged lines. Frequency of maintenance will depend upon usage. Refer to Section 18 for recommendations for testing, inspection, and general maintenance of choke and kill line systems. An adequate supply of spare parts is important for components subject to wear or damage or whose failure seriously reduces the effectiveness of the system. Standardization of components is recommended to minimize the inventory required. Although the inventory will vary from rig to rig, a generalized recommended spare parts list includes: j. All lines should be firmly anchored to prevent excessive whip or vibration. k. All lines and fittings should have a bore of sufficient size to prevent excessive erosion or fluid friction: 1. Minimum recommended nominal inside diameter for lines downstream of the chokes is the nominal connection size of the chokes. 2. Lines downstream of the choke manifold are not normally required to contain pressure (refer to Tables 3 and 4 for testing considerations). 3. The bleed line (the line that bypasses the chokes) should be at least equal in diameter to the choke line. This line allows circulation of the well with the preventers closed while maintaining a minimum back pressure. It also permits high volume bleed off of well fluids to relieve casing pressure with the preventers closed. Explain g. The flexible choke and kill line manufacturer’s guidelines should be consulted to determine/verify moonpool choke and kill line operating parameters. h. It is important to consult the flexible choke/kill line manufacturer’s guidelines for proper length determination and proper routing to ensure non-entrapment of pods and safe operating Configuration which will allow full-designed deflection of the flex/ball joint. The flexible line manufacturer should be consulted prior to any modifications to the lower marine riser package to ensure subsequent safe working conditions for the flexible lines. i. All choke and kill lines should be as straight as possible. When bends are required to facilitate hook-up provide the largest practical bend radius. Following is guidance for bends in different types of lines. 1. For rigid lines, because erosion at bends is possible during operation, consideration should be given to using erosion resistant flow targets at bends and on block ells and tees. The degree to which pipe bends are susceptible to erosion depends on the bend radius, flow rate, flow medium, pipe wall thickness, and pipe material. However, in general, short radius pipe bends (R/d < 10) should be targeted in the direction of expected flow. For large radius pipe bends (R/d > 10), targets are generally unnecessary. Bends sometime have a wall thickness greater than the straight pipe in the choke system (such as the next higher schedule) to further compensate for the effect of erosion. 90 0 block ells and tees should be targeted in the direction of flow. Where: R = Radius of pipe bend measured at the centerline. d = Nominal diameter of the pipe. 2. For flexible lines, consult the manufacturer’s guidelines on working minimum bend radius to ensure proper length determination and safe working configuration. 3. For articulated line assemblies, consult the manufacturer’s written specifications to determine the degree of relative movement allowed between end points. d. Each BOP outlet connected to the choke or kill line should have two full-opening valves adjacent to the preventers. These valves are hydraulically operated pressure assist open and spring close. Spring closure can also be assisted with hydraulic pressure. Periodic pumping through the valves is necessary since they are normally closed and may become plugged if not occasionally flushed. e. Location of the choke and kill line openings on the BOP stack depends on the particular configuration of the preventers and the operator’s preferred flexibility for well control operations. Example arrangements are shown in Figure 14. Other arrangements may be equally adequate to meet well control requirements. Refer to 7.3.1 for guidance on arrangement considerations. f. Flexible connections required for choke and kill lines, both at the top and bottom of the marine riser, should have a pressure rating equaling or exceeding the rated working pressure of the ram BOPS. Figures 15 and 16 illustrate example flexible choke and kill connections for subsea BOP installations. 10 Chevron Has a complete inventory of recommended spares been developed and are the recommended spares available at the rig site?

A diverter is not designed to shut in or halt flow, but rather permits routing of the flow away from the rig. The system deals with the potentially hazardous flows which may be experienced prior to setting the casing string on which' the BOP stack and choke manifold will be installed. The system is designed to pack-off around the kelly, drill string or casing to divert flow in a safe direction. Diverters having annular packing units can also close on open hole.

Blowout prevention equipment systems are composed of all systems required to operate the blowout preventers (BOPs) under varying rig and well conditions. These systems are: blowout preventers (BOPs), choke and kill lines, choke manifold, hydraulic control system, marine riser, and auxiliary equipment. The primary functions of these systems are to confine well fluids to the wellbore, provide means to add fluid to the wellbore, and allow controlled volumes to be withdrawn from the wellbore. In addition, diverter systems are addressed in this Recommended Practice, though their primary purpose is to safely divert flow rather than to confine fluids to the wellbore"".

The hose sheave should permit installation of the umbilical without disconnecting from the hydraulic junction box assemblies to which the umbilical may be terminated. Some systems are two BOP stack systems where the larger stack has only one control pod. However, most systems are single stack where there are two completely redundant control pods on the BOP stack when drilling out from under surface casing. Each control pod should contain all necessary valves and regulators to operate the BOP stack functions. The control pods may be retrievable or non-retrievable. The hoses from each control pod should be connected to a shuttle valve that is connected to the function to be operated. All functions required to run, land, or retrieve the lower marine riser package and/or the BOP stack should remain fully active during landing and retrieval. Hose sheaves should facilitate running and retrieving the subsea umbilical from the hose reel through the moonpool and support the moonpool loop which is deployed to compensate for vessel heave. 15 d.

Pacific Sharav Contract 2012 06 15 Executed - EMail.pdf.txt,NOTHING,"11.3 INSTALLATION GUIDELINES Chevron Chevron c. Subsea choke/kill lines are connected to their counterpart(s) on adjoining riser joints by box-and- pin, stab-in couplings. The box contains an elastomeric radial seal that expands against the smooth, abrasion-resistant sealing surface of the pin when the line is pressurized. The stab-in couplings also facilitate fast makeup while deploying the marine riser. Some of the more important considerations concerning subsea choke and kill lines are: a. Selection of choke and kill line connectors must take into consideration the ease of connect/disconnect operations and the dependability of sealing elements for those emergency situations where it is necessary to disconnect the riser from the BOP stack and then reconnect again prior to resuming normal operations. b. Connector pressure sealing elements should be inspected, changed as required, and tested before being placed in service. Periodic pressure testing is recommended during installation. Pressure ratings of all lines and sealing elements should equal or exceed the rated working pressure of the ram BOPS. For subsea BOP installations choke and kill lines are connected (through the choke manifold) to permit pumping or flowing through either line. Choke and kill lines for subsea BOP installations are installed opposite one another on the exterior of the marine riser (refer to Figure 13). Choke and kill lines are normally 3 inch (7.62 cm) nominal diameter or larger. The identifying labels for the respective subsea choke and kill lines are arbitrary. Traditionally, where a circulating line is connected to an outlet below the lowermost ram BOP, this circulating line is generally designated as a kill line. Kill Lines-Surface BOP Installations Preventive maintenance of the choke assembly and controls should be performed regularly, checking particularly for wear and plugged or damaged lines. Frequency of maintenance will depend upon usage. Refer to Section 18 for recommendations for testing, inspection, and general maintenance of choke systems. An adequate supply of spare parts is important for components subject to wear or damage or whose failure seriously reduces the effectiveness of the manifold. Standardization of components is recommended to minimize the inventory required. Although the inventory will vary from rig to rig, a generalized recommended minimum spare parts list includes: Explain n. Lines downstream of the choke manifold should be securely anchored, be of sufficient size to permit reasonable flow rates without excessive friction, and permit flow direction either to a mud/gas separator, vent lines, or to production facilities or emergency storage. Figure 9 illustrates an example choke manifold. Configurations of choke manifolds may vary widely as a result of space limitations, operator’s policies, etc. Refinements or modifications such as additional hydraulic valves and choke runs, wear nipples downstream of chokes, redundant pressure gauges, and/or manifolding of bypass lines may be dictated by the conditions anticipated for a particular well and the degree of protection desired, The guidelines discussed and illustrated represent examples of industry practice.

The valve(s) should be installed close to the annular sealing device to minimize space for cuttings to collect and plug the vent line(s). If a valve(s) is not used in the diverter system or if the valve cannot be installed near the annular sealing device, the diverter system vent line(s) or riser pipe should be equipped to allow for flushing drill cuttings from the vent line(s)"". Explain: ""Refer to 5.7 and its sub-paragraphs. The vent line outlet(s) and vent line(s) should be installed below the diverter and extended a sufficient distance and direction from the rig to permit safe venting of diverted well fluids. For onshore drilling operations, a single vent line oriented downwind or crosswind from the rig and facilities is typically used and discharged to the pit. However, it may be desirable to provide a second vent line that discharges into a second pit and is oriented in a different direction as a precaution against changes in prevailing winds. For most bottom-supported marine drilling operations, two vent lines, oriented in different directions, are normally used. Some offshore drilling/production platforms use only one vent line due to prevailing winds"". Explain: Onshore and/or Bottom-supported Marine Drilling Operations GENERAL ""These operations include drilling from any land or marine structure supported by a mat type base, legs, or a barge that rests on the bottom. In the marine environment, these operations include jack- up drilling rigs, barge rigs, and production platforms. Shut-in of the BOP on a shallow fluid flow may cause the formation to fracture and allow wellbore fluids to flow up the outside of the casing to the surface. In addition to the other hazards associated with uncontrolled flows to the surface, these flows may cause damage to, or failure of, the rig foundation. Bottom-founded drilling units in a marine environment are vulnerable to foundation failure under these conditions and may overturn or collapse. Production platforms have additional exposure due to the presence of oil and gas processing facilities, pipeline connections, and producing wells as well as production and service personnel on board"".

The valve(s) should be installed close to the annular sealing device to minimize space for cuttings to collect and plug the vent line(s). If a valve(s) is not used in the diverter system or if the valve cannot be installed near the annular sealing device, the diverter system vent line(s) or riser pipe should be equipped to allow for flushing drill cuttings from the vent line(s)"". Explain: ""Refer to 5.7 and its sub-paragraphs. The vent line outlet(s) and vent line(s) should be installed below the diverter and extended a sufficient distance and direction from the rig to permit safe venting of diverted well fluids. For onshore drilling operations, a single vent line oriented downwind or crosswind from the rig and facilities is typically used and discharged to the pit. However, it may be desirable to provide a second vent line that discharges into a second pit and is oriented in a different direction as a precaution against changes in prevailing winds. For most bottom-supported marine drilling operations, two vent lines, oriented in different directions, are normally used. Some offshore drilling/production platforms use only one vent line due to prevailing winds"". Explain: Onshore and/or Bottom-supported Marine Drilling Operations GENERAL ""These operations include drilling from any land or marine structure supported by a mat type base, legs, or a barge that rests on the bottom. In the marine environment, these operations include jack- up drilling rigs, barge rigs, and production platforms. Shut-in of the BOP on a shallow fluid flow may cause the formation to fracture and allow wellbore fluids to flow up the outside of the casing to the surface. In addition to the other hazards associated with uncontrolled flows to the surface, these flows may cause damage to, or failure of, the rig foundation. Bottom-founded drilling units in a marine environment are vulnerable to foundation failure under these conditions and may overturn or collapse. Production platforms have additional exposure due to the presence of oil and gas processing facilities, pipeline connections, and producing wells as well as production and service personnel on board"".

This safety factor shall be added to the 100% value of the design calculations for the system design to ensure that sufficient volume and pressure are available for completing the rapid discharge sequence. Unlike function testing, the rapid discharge system does not require it to be performed unless specifically addressed in the contracting requirements. a. Stored Hydraulic Fluid. The fluid volume recoverable from the accumulator system between the maximum designed accumulator operating pressure and the precharge pressure. In deep water operations, hydraulic signal transmission time is lengthened by physical expansion of the fluid conductor hose as the internal pressure surges. Electro-hydraulic and multiplex control systems can be used in deep water where response times of hydraulic signals are too lengthy. Electrical command signals transmitted over lengthy subsea cables have shorter response times than hydraulic pilot signals transmitted over hose bundles of equal length. Electrical command signals operate subsea solenoid valves which, in turn, provide hydraulic pilot signals directly to operate the pod valves that direct power fluid to the subsea functions. Electro-hydraulic control systems have parallel capability to execute and receive commands, whereas multiplex control systems process multiple signals on each conductor set. Electro- hydraulic systems have conductor wires in the subsea umbilical cable dedicated to each function. Multiplex (MUX) systems serialize and code the command signals that are then sent subsea via shared conductors in the umbilical cable. Multiplex control system logic may incorporate additional security by requiring verification before execution of the function. Subsea data are electrically transmitted to the surface. Section 14 is redundant to Section 13. Only those items that differ from Direct Hydraulic Control Systems will require confirmation or clarification. Each closing unit should have a fluid reservoir with a capacity equal to at least twice the usable fluid capacity of the accumulator system. A suitable hydraulic fluid should be used as the closing unit control operating fluid. Sufficient volume of glycol must be added to any closing unit fluid containing water if ambient temperatures below 32 0 F (0 0 C) are anticipated. 16 ",2546,False

Inspections and maintenance procedures shall take into consideration the manufacturer’s published recommendations . Inspection recommendations, where applicable, may include: a. Verification of instrument accuracy. Deadman Systems A deadman system is a safety system that is designed to automatically close the wellbore in the event of a simultaneous absence of hydraulic supply and signal transmission capacity in both subsea control pods. This is considered a “rapid discharge” system. Is a Deadman safety system installed? Explain: Autoshear Systems Autoshear is a safety system that is designed to automatically shut in the wellbore in the event of a disconnect of the LMRP. When the autoshear is armed, a disconnect of the LMRP closes the shear rams. This is considered a “rapid discharge” system. Is an Autoshear safety system installed? Explain: For deepwater/harsh environment operations, particularly where multiplex BOP controls and dynamic positioning of the vessel are used, special control system features may be employed. Autoshear and deadman systems are optional safety systems that are designed to automatically shut in the wellbore during unplanned emergency events. These systems both utilize subsea accumulators to provide power fluid, and may be powered by a shared accumulator, such as acoustic system, that is not discharged into the main hydraulic supply. A single control system may incorporate both the autoshear and the deadman features. Both the autoshear system and the deadman system shall be manually armed and disarmed. The sequence of events in these systems is specified by the purchaser.

Pacific Sharav Contract 2012 06 15 Executed - EMail.pdf.txt,NOTHING,"18.5.10.1 The BOP elastomeric components that may be exposed to well fluids should be verified by the BOP manufacturer as appropriate for the drilling fluids to be used and for the anticipated temperatures. Consideration should be given to the temperature and fluid conditions during well testing and completion operations. Manufacturers’ markings for BOP elastomeric components should include the durometer hardness, generic type of compound, date of manufacture, part number, and operating temperature range of the component. Blind rams and blind shear rams should not be tested when pipe is in the stack. The capability of the shear ram and ram operator should be verified with the manufacturer for the planned drill string. The shear ram preventer design and/or metallurgical differences among drill pipe manufacturers may require high closing pressures for shear operations. When drill pipe hang off is a possibility during well control, hang off procedures should be preplanned. The manufacturer’s recommended hang off load capacity for fixed-bore ram blocks should be considered. Example hang off procedures are included in API Recommended Practice 59. The original ram BOP equipment manufacturer should be consulted regarding hanging off drill pipe on variable bore ram BOPs. Prior to surface testing each ram BOP, the secondary rod seal (emergency packoff assembly) should be checked to ensure the seals have not been energized. Should the ram shaft seal leak during the stump test, the seal shall be repaired rather than energizing the secondary packing. Ram BOPS equipped with hydraulic ram locks should be pressure tested with ram locks in the closed position and closing pressure vented. Unless restricted by height, the entire stack should be pressure tested as a unit. Annular BOPs should be tested using the smallest OD pipe to be used. Fixed bore pipe rams should be tested only on the pipe OD size that matches the installed pipe ram blocks. Variable bore rams should be initially pressure tested on the largest and the smallest OD pipe sizes that may be used during the well operation. b. Flow-type tests should be sufficient to determine if leaks exist. The rig’s available well control equipment may have a higher rated working pressure than required. Site specific test requirements should be considered in these situations. The subsea stack equipment includes the subsea wellbore pressure containing equipment above the wellhead and below the ball/flex joint. This equipment includes the wellhead and LMRP connectors, ram BOPs, spool(s), annular(s), choke and kill valves, and choke and kill lines. Refer to Chevron Diverter System Acceptance Inspection & Test Plan When in primary diverter service (no BOP installed), function tests should be performed on the diverter system at appropriate times, using the driller’s panel to verify that functions are operable. Fluid should be pumped through each diverter line at appropriate times during operations to ensure that line(s) are not plugged. Notes: a. The low pressure test should be stable for at least 5 minutes. If hydrogen sulfide bearing formations are anticipated the manufacturer certification for compliance with NACE Standard MR0175 should be available for well control equipment, as described in Section 20. All diverter system components shall be inspected and tested to ascertain proper installation and functioning. Simulate loss of rig air supply to the diverter control system and determine effects, if any, on the diverter system and vent line valves. Vessel motion and pressure limitation(s) of riser f. In cold climates, the diverter vent lines should be protected from freezing. Possible methods include flushing with antifreeze solution, draining, insulation, and heat tracing. b. For installations using remote operators, record hydraulic pressure and air supply pressure with the accumulator fully charged and the controls in the normal drilling position. c. Actuate the diverter close and open sequence with drill pipe or test mandrel in the diverter to verify control functions, proper equipment operating sequence and interlock, if applicable, and record response time(s). d. Typically only function and flow-through tests are performed. However, an optional pressure integrity test [200 psi (1.38 MPa)] may be made on the diverter system on installation.

Pacific Sharav Contract 2012 06 15 Executed - EMail.pdf.txt,NOTHING,"5.4.5 YES or NO YES or NO Central Control Unit (CCU) In systems employing a CCU, the CCU is the central control point (corresponding to the hydraulic control manifold of a discrete hydraulic control system). When used to satisfy the requirements of 5.2.4 and 5.2.5, the CCU shall provide full functional and pressure regulation capability . Upon restoration of power, following an electrical power interruption, the CCU shall boot up all functions in the non-energized position . Command Signals Electrical command signals transmitted over lengthy subsea umbilical cables have shorter response times than hydraulic pilot signals transmitted over hose bundles of equal length. Electrical command signals operate subsea solenoid valves which, in turn, provide hydraulic pilot signals directly to operate the pod valves that direct power fluid to the subsea functions. A MUX control system processes multiple signals on each signal conductor in the umbilical. Multiplex systems serialize and code the command signals which are then sent subsea via shared conductors in the umbilical cable. Multiplex control system logic can incorporate additional security by requiring transmission of a coded message to the subsea pod, return of the message to the surface by the pod electronics package for verification, and re-transmitting the verified command before execution of the function. An electro-hydraulic system has a pair of conductor wires in the subsea umbilical cable dedicated to each function. Explain: Electrical Power Electrical power (excluding the pump systems) shall be supplied from one or more uninterruptable power supplies with backup battery capacities to operate the controls for at least 2 hours . Explain: a. Two (2) complete sets of solenoid valves and pilot-operated control valves with each set mounted in each control pod located on the LMRP. b. Two (2) control cables, each stored on and deployed from an umbilical reel, to connect the two subsea pods to the surface control equipment. c. Two (2) or more means of surface/subsea power fluid supply. (examples: hydraulic conduit[s], hydraulic umbilical hose[s]). At least one of these means shall satisfy the response time requirements specified in this section, and two (or more) supplies shall be selectable from at least two primary control stations. Electro-hydraulic/multiplex (MUX) control systems employ multi-conductor armored subsea umbilical cables deployed from storage reels aboard the vessel. The cables transmit coded commands that activate solenoid operated pilot valves in the subsea pods. Within the pod, each solenoid valve activates a pilot-operated control valve to direct power fluid to a particular function. Explain: Redundancy Because the subsea BOP stack is not easily accessible for maintenance and repair, redundant (backup) system elements shall be deployed. Specifically these include: Accumulators and manifolds for hydraulic control systems for subsea BOP stacks shall meet the requirements of 5.2. Explain: ELECTRO-HYDRAULIC AND MULTIPLEX (MUX) CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR SUBSEA BOP STACKS General b.

Clamps shall be designated by the clamp number shown in Table 15. Clamp connectors shall be designed according to 5.4.2. Each clamp shall be designed for the highest loading that may be induced by any hub it is intended to fit. Stresses shall be calculated at make-up, operating and test conditions. a) the bolt load required to seat the gasket and bring the hub faces into contact, or b) the bolt load required to retain the sum of the rated working pressure end load and the gasket-retaining load. Make-up of the clamp shall be sufficient such that the hub faces meet and there is no facial separation at the hub OD at rated working pressure. Operating stresses shall be determined using the stresses resulting from the sum of the rated working pressure end load and the gasket-retaining load. Test condition stresses shall be determined using the stresses resulting from the sum of the test pressure end load and the gasket-retaining load. The stresses shall be determined using the outside radius of the gasket as the sealing radius.

The coefficient of friction shall be considered and shall be + 0,1 at make-up and − 0,1 while operating. Friction, therefore, inhibits make-up and assists in holding the connection at operating and test conditions. The clamp bore shall provide a minimum of 3 mm (0,125 in) radial clearance around the hub neck in the made-up condition on all hubs it is designed to fit. All clamps shall have one or more bolts at each connecting point. Spherical-face heavy hexagonal nuts or spherical washers shall be used to minimize potential bending in bolts.
